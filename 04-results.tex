\section{Results}
We present results from Belady, Random(rand), FIFO, and all of the RRIP policies (SRRIP, DRRIP, BRRIP).
These polcies were run against a trace of sp\_omp run on a single core, with a 8-way set associative cache, with 7 bits of direct mapping within each set, and 64 byte cache lines.
We limited the graphs to only show MATR because we believe that for this particular trace,
 and this set of replacement polcies, this TTR best shows the usefulness of the TTR metrics in general.

Figures~\ref{matr:buc:belady}-\ref{matr:buc:brrip} show each individual replacement policy,
 as well as the error in measurement due to our sampling strategy.
Figures~\ref{matr:buc:belady:srrip}-\ref{matr:buc:drrip:brrip} show a side-by-side comparison of two different replacement policies.

In each graph, any $(x,y)$ point corresponds to $y$ evictions that took $x$ thousand memory accesses to be recached.
To smooth out the graph, these points have been collected into $1000$ buckets,
 each bucket represents an area of 500 Memory Access.
